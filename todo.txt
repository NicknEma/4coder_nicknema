TODO FOR SHAWN
 [ ] Project File Opener: Ignore directories, recursively list options.
 [ ] Recent Files Menu: this isn't bad!  If it just defaulted to the first one
     (but still allowed typing), and if the key that opened it continued to cycle
     the items in the list (rather than closing the lister), that'd be pretty much
     it!
 [ ] Tabbing: This is really close, the only problem is if the end of the selection
     isn't at the beginning of a line it does something really weird -- I'm not sure 
     what.  It shouldn't matter where the caret is, if multiple lines are selected
     then tab should move the lines
 [ ] Comments: Very close!  The only problem is the multiple selection, single line 
     comments: instead of putting the  at the start of each line after the whitespace, 
     the  should be lined up with the shallowest whitespace..
 [ ] Pressing tab on an empty line inside a scope still doesn't do anything.
 [ ] ctrl E centres the buffer on the current line,  vim has z. There's:
     zz -> middle, zt-> top, zb->bottom, but also: z5t will centre it 5
     lines from the top or whatever... is that something that's easy to add?
