  [X] Fix identifiers starting with 'u' acting weird
  [ ] Allow optional semicolons with auto indentation
 [ ] Fonts size only works if it loads the custom font (which has to be in the fonts
     directory). It currently doesn't work for the default font. Fix.
 [X] Fix the tooltip that should be at the bottom but isn't
 [ ] Hot reloading of themes, projects, configs and bindings
 [ ] Maximize window by default
 [ ] Proportional font for UI, monospaced for code

 [ ] Peek definition
 [ ] Recursively walk imports/includes, record types, macros, constants, procedures, global variables.
 [ ] The build_lexers.bat emits a "The system could not find the path specified" message even though it does everything as it should.
     I don't know what it's referring to. Maybe it doesn't matter, but it's annoying.


TODO FOR SHAWN
 [ ] Project File Opener: Ignore directories, recursively list options.
 [ ] Recent Files Menu: this isn't bad!  If it just defaulted to the first one
     (but still allowed typing), and if the key that opened it continued to cycle
     the items in the list (rather than closing the lister), that'd be pretty much
     it!
 [ ] Tabbing: This is really close, the only problem is if the end of the selection
     isn't at the beginning of a line it does something really weird -- I'm not sure 
     what.  It shouldn't matter where the caret is, if multiple lines are selected
     then tab should move the lines
 [ ] Comments: Very close!  The only problem is the multiple selection, single line 
     comments: instead of putting the  at the start of each line after the whitespace, 
     the  should be lined up with the shallowest whitespace..
 [ ] Pressing tab on an empty line inside a scope still doesn't do anything.
 [ ] ctrl E centres the buffer on the current line,  vim has z. There's:
     zz -> middle, zt-> top, zb->bottom, but also: z5t will centre it 5
     lines from the top or whatever... is that something that's easy to add? 

ORIGINAL REQUEST
 [ ] Fix not showing .-lister when cursor is at end of query
 [ ] Cycle overloads, or list them all
 [ ] Ctrl+I but just for the project buffers
 [ ] Vertical edits



TODO FOR CASEY
 [ ] Fix clipboard stuff
 [ ] CPM counter shenanigans



TODO PLOTS
 [ ] Un-Bust Histograms
 [ ] Fix plot clip rect bugs when the plot is not 100% in the visible range
     (caused by 4coder laying out characters off the screen as being at 0, 0)
 [ ] Labels for histogram bins
 [ ] Plots and Calc are so coupled and I hate it, please rewrite or something



TODO META
 [X] Project-wide todo list (by searching for TODO and DONE comments, lister for toggling)
 [ ] Project switcher
 [ ] Plan + do modal input scheme... Identifier-mode, text-mode, semantics mode, search mode...?
